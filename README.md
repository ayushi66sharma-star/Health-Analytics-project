# Mental Health Survey - Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository contains a mini-project performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey. The analysis explores workplace attitudes, resource availability, and awareness of mental health issues in the tech industry.

Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) in Jupyter Notebook, the project includes data cleaning, visualization, and insights generation. Visuals cover trends such as gender distribution, resource availability, and correlations between workplace factors and mental health.
